<summary>About Me</summary>
<br>
I have always had two loves, computing and the human body. I studied exercise science and became fascinated with biomechanics. Throughout undergrad and after graduation, I worked as a basketball coach. I used basketball to not only improve my leadership and communication skills but also to explore biomechanics. I focused primarily on teaching athletes optimal form. Unfortunately, the pandemic shut down most sports leagues. During that time, I decided to switch gears and explore that other passion, computing. I can now combine these two passions and bring a lot to a team. Not only in terms of the technology but also with my experience in biomechanics and working with athletes.
